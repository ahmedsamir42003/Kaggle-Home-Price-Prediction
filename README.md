# Kaggle-Home-Price-Prediction

This repository contains the code and files related to our team's participation in the Kaggle competition for predicting home prices in Ames, Iowa. We achieved excellent results by utilizing advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting.

## Competition Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. However, this Kaggle competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenged participants to predict the final price of each home. It provided an incredible opportunity for data science students and practitioners to expand their skill set and apply creative feature engineering techniques.
